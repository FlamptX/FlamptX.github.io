I have created a sign up/login program that will store the data even when the browser is closed.
The data is stored in browser's local storage. Signing up will create an account and you can login with the details you signed up with. I didn't manage to make it so there is unlimited number of accounts that can be created. I may add that soon, but for now ten accounts is gonnna be enough. If you want to use my code or just a part make sure the credit me-
